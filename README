# CHIP cloner

NOTE: as of now it is only possible to create images *of* Hynix CHIPs.
It is possible to create images *for* Toshiba CHIPs though.

NOTE: as of now, cloned chips cannot be cloned again

0. Have a current version of Docker installed on your work station.
1. Put the CHIP that's supposed to be cloned into fel mode and connect it to your computer via USB
2. Start Chrome, got to flash.getchip.com, click flash, wait until CHIP autodetection is done.
3. Select "Choose an Image..." and select clone.chp included in this repository (CAREFUL: if you select the wrong image here your CHIP might be overwritten...)
4. Wait until "flashing" is done - actually nothing is written onto your CHIP it's booted in to a ram disk image
5. Run clone.sh from the current directory
6. If everything went well you should now have an image.chp in your current directory.

## Knonw Issues:

-WIFI: cloned chips seem to miss wlan0 - this can be fixed by deleting /etc/udev/rules.d on the device
       the file will be re-created on next boot
     TODO: - exclude this file when creating the rootfs.tar?
           - what else should be excluded? ssh-host keys?
     NOTE: - we should distinguish between:'
           -- a) backup (to be restored by same user, keep credentials and ssh host keys?)
           -- b) generic image creation (wipe wifi credentials, ssh host and client keys, etc.)
